# Topics covered so far:

*At initial build of this page*
- Linux command line
- Git to Github basics (clone, add, commit, push)
- Commit early and often!
- Markdown
- HTML and CSS (Box model, Flexbox)

# Notes to self:

*After completing the project*
- customised it to make the project fun for myself
- for this webpage i used solely Flexbox, everything is a flexbox - which meant i had to make multiple single child divs (esp for those with full width bg-color
- even body is a flexbox - so that i could center all the items without setting paddings

*taking quote block as example*
1. flex div for bg-color (width 100%, padding top bottom only)
2. flex div for quote-content (max-width, margin left right)
3.  quote div - align-self: flex-start, max-width
    quote-author - align-self: flex-end

## Most satisfying part is better using the flexbox and box model
